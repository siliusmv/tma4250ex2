# Problem 3: Clustered event spatial variables

## a)

The Neumann-Scott cluster model is a good model for simulating events from a clustered event RF. 


```{r}

mothers <- 12
children <- 5
sigma <- 0.05
area <- c(0, 1, 0, 1)

cluster_args <- list(lambda_m = mothers, lambda_c = children, sigma = sigma, area = area)

testIfPois(data = red_data,
           simulatePois = clusterMC,
           args = cluster_args,
           title = "redwood")

```
