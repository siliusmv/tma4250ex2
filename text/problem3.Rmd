# Problem 3: Clustered event spatial variables

## a)

The Neumann-Scott cluster model is a model for describing a clustered event RF.
Mother-locations are distributed according to a homogenuous Poisson process with intensity $\lambda_M$ inside an area $\mathbf{D}$. Centered at each mother-location, a set of child-events are independently distributed with count pdf $p(k^c)$ and intensity pdf $p(\bm{x} | \bm{x}_j^M)$, where $\bm{x}_j^M$ is mother-location number $j$. For this model, the count pdf $p(k^c)$ is a Poisson distribution with intensity $\lambda_c$, and the intensity $p(\bm{x} | \bm{x}_j^M)$ is a normal distribution centered at $\bm{x}_j^M$ with covariance matrix $\sigma_c^2 \mathbf{I}$. All children-events that are located outside $\mathbf{D}$ must be removed.
Only the children-events are counted as events in the resulting model.

This gives the pdf 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mother-child}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{X}_D &\sim p(\bm{x}_{ji}; j = 1, 2, ..., k_D^M; i = 1, 2, ..., k_{Dj}^c) \\
 &= \prod_{j = 1}^{k_D^M} \left(\left[\prod_{i = 1}^{k_{Dj}^c} \frac{I(\bm{x}_{ji} \in \mathbf{D}) p(\bm{x}_{ji} | \bm{x}_j^M)}{P(\mathbf{D} | \bm{x}_j^M)} \right] \times p(k_{Dj}^c | k_j^c, \bm{x}_j^M) p(k_j^c) \times \frac{1}{|\mathbf{D}|^{k_D^M}} p(k_D^M) \right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The pdf in \eqref{eq:mother-child} are divided into three parts. The first factor is 0 when a child-event is outside $\mathbf{D}$ and \todo{finish this!}

The Neumann-Scott event RF model in not analytically tractable, but realisations are simple to generate. \todo{this is copied from the compendium. Is that okay?} First, the number of mother-locations is generated and the locations are distributed uniformly on $\mathbf{D}$. Then, for each mother location, the number of child-events are generated, and the child-events are distributed according to their intensity pdf's. At last, all child-events outside $\mathbf{D}$ are removed.

By studying the redwood tree data in figure \@ref(fig:processes), we try to fit the Neumann-Scott model using the parameters $\lambda_M = 12$, $\lambda_c = 5$, $\sigma_c^2 = 0.05^2$. 100 realisations of the model is simulated, and empirical 0.9-confidence intervals for the $\mathbf{L}$-function is displayed along with the empirical $\mathbf{L}$-function for the redwood tree data. The result can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:mother-child).

(ref:mother-child) Empirical $\mathbf{L}$-function for the redwood data along with empirical 0.9-confidence intervals for the $\mathbf{L}$-function. Thes are made from simulation of 100 Neumann-Scott event RF models with parameters $\lambda_M = 12$, $\lambda_c = 5$, $\sigma_c^2 = 0.05^2$.

```{r mother-child, fig.cap = "(ref:mother-child)"}

mothers <- 12
children <- 5
sigma <- 0.05
area <- c(0, 1, 0, 1)

cluster_args <- list(lambda_m = mothers, lambda_c = children, sigma = sigma, area = area)

testIfPois(data = red_data,
           simulatePois = clusterMC,
           args = cluster_args,
           title = "Redwood tree data")

```
